# Henrik Ibsen: The Father of Modern Drama

Henrik Johan Ibsen was born on March 20, 1828, in Skien, Norway. He is widely regarded as one of the most significant playwrights of modern drama and a pioneering figure in the development of realistic theatre. His works include "A Doll's House," "Ghosts," "An Enemy of the People," and "Hedda Gabler."

## Early Life

Ibsen grew up in poverty after his father's financial ruin due to business failures. He was sent to the small town of Grimstad at a young age, where he worked as an apprentice pharmacist. Despite these humble beginnings, Ibsen developed a passion for literature and began writing poetry and plays while still in his teens.

### Education and Early Career
Ibsen's formal education was limited, but he continued to pursue his literary interests. In 1846, he moved to Christiania (now Oslo) to study at the university and work as an apothecary assistant. He soon abandoned this career path in favor of writing full-time.

## Early Plays

Ibsen's early plays were Romantic and historical dramas that did not achieve commercial success but laid the groundwork for his later works. His breakthrough came with "The Feast at Solhaug" (1856), which was his first play to be staged professionally.

### Notable Works

## Rise to Fame

### Social Realism
In the 1870s and 1880s, Ibsen turned his attention to social issues and began writing realistic plays that challenged traditional values and bourgeois conventions. These works often featured complex female characters who question their roles in society.

## Major Works

- **Hedda Gabler** (1890): A play that centers around Hedda, a woman trapped in an unhappy marriage, struggling with her own ambitions and desires.

### Later Works
Ibsen's later plays continued to challenge social norms and explore psychological depth. Some notable works include:

- **The Wild Duck** (1884): An exploration of the destructive nature of illusions.
- **Rosmersholm** (1886): A play about a man torn between his past life and his desire for moral reform.
- **Hedda Gabler** (1890): Often cited as one of Ibsen's finest works, focusing on the inner conflicts of Hedda, who is trapped in an oppressive society.
