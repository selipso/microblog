# Lucy Maud Montgomery: The Author of "Anne of Green Gables"

Lucy Maud Montgomery (1874-1942), often referred to as L.M. Montgomery, was a renowned Canadian author best known for her beloved novel "Anne of Green Gables." Her works are celebrated for their vivid depictions of rural life in Prince Edward Island and the imaginative spirit of her iconic character Anne Shirley.

## Early Life

Born on November 30, 1874, in Clifton (now New London), Prince Edward Island, Canada, Montgomery was named after her paternal grandmother Lucy and mother's middle name Maud. Her parents died when she was a young child—her father left to serve as a Church of Scotland minister in western Canada, while her mother passed away from tuberculosis shortly after giving birth.

Left in the care of her strict maternal grandparents, Montgomery faced a challenging childhood. Her grandfather, Hugh John McDonald, was a stern and religiously conservative man who instilled in her a love for nature and literature despite his disapproval of fiction. It was during these formative years that Montgomery developed her passion for writing as an escape from the rigors of her daily life.
