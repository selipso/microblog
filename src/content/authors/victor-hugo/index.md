# Victor Hugo: The Great French Writer

Victor Hugo, born on February 26, 1802, in Besançon, France, was one of the most influential and versatile writers of the Romantic era. He is best known for his novels such as "Les Misérables" and "Notre-Dame de Paris," as well as his poetry and plays.

## Early Life

Victor Hugo's family was closely tied to the military and political elite. His father, Joseph-Léopold Sigisbert Hugo, served in Napoleon Bonaparte's army, while his mother, Sophie Trébuchet, came from a prominent bourgeois family. Despite their high social standing, the couple often clashed over ideological differences.

### Childhood and Education
Victor spent his early years in Paris but moved frequently due to his father’s military postings. His parents' turbulent relationship had a profound impact on him during his formative years. Hugo received a classical education and showed an early talent for writing poetry and prose.

## Literary Career

Hugo's literary career began in earnest with the publication of "Odes et poésies diverses" (1822), which won him the Prix de l'Académie Française at the age of 20. He quickly became a prominent figure in French Romanticism.

### Early Works
- **Hernani** (1830): A play that was famously attacked by critics for its romantic and revolutionary themes but launched Hugo's career as a playwright.
- **Les Misérables** (1862): This novel is one of his most famous works, chronicling the life and struggles of Jean Valjean and other characters against a backdrop of French history.

### Later Works
Hugo continued to produce literary masterpieces well into his later years. Some notable works include:

- **Notre-Dame de Paris** (1831): Often known in English as "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame," this novel explores the life and death of Quasimodo, a bell-ringer with a deformed appearance.
- **Les Misérables** (1862): A monumental work that delves into social issues such as poverty, justice, and redemption through its intricate plot and memorable characters.
- **L'Année Terrible** (1872): A collection of poems written during the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune.

## Political Views

Victor Hugo was not only a prolific writer but also an outspoken political figure. He was deeply involved in social and political issues throughout his life, often using his literary works to advocate for reform and justice.

### Exile
In 1851, after Napoleon III's coup d'état, Hugo went into exile on the Channel Islands (Guernsey and Jersey) until 1870. During this time, he continued to write prolifically, producing some of his most famous works, including "Les Misérables."

### Return to France
After the fall of Napoleon III in 1870, Hugo returned to Paris as a national hero. He was elected as a deputy for Paris and later served as a senator.

## Personal Life

Hugo's personal life was marked by tragedy and triumph. His first wife, Adèle Foucher, bore him five children but died tragically young in 1868. Despite the loss of his wife, Hugo continued to write and remained deeply involved in political affairs until his death on May 22, 1885.

## Influence and Legacy
