Tobias George Smollett (1721-1771) was an influential Scottish novelist, poet, and medical doctor who played a significant role in shaping 18th-century English literature. Known for his robust style, satirical wit, and picaresque novels, Smollett’s works offer vivid portrayals of society and adventure.

## Early Life

Tobias George Smollett was born on December 19, 1721, in Dalquhurn, near Dumbarton, Scotland. He came from a family with modest means but received an excellent education at the University of Glasgow where he studied medicine. After completing his medical degree, Smollett briefly practiced as a surgeon before setting sail to the West Indies and South America.

## Travels and Early Writings

In 1746, Smollett began traveling extensively, spending time in Spain and South America, which provided rich material for his later writings. His experiences during these travels were published in "The Present State of Scotland," a satirical pamphlet that criticized Scottish society.
