Alexandre Dumas was born on July 24, 1802, in Villers-Cotterêts, France.

His mother, Marie-Louise Labouret, supported the family by managing her late husband's estate.

Despite his limited formal education, Dumas learned much from his father's extensive library and the stories of his grandfather, Marshal Antoine Davy de La Pailletrie, a hero of the American Revolutionary War.
