# William Shakespeare: The Bard of Avon

William Shakespeare (1564-1616) is widely regarded as the greatest playwright and poet in the English language. Born April 23, 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, he has left an indelible mark on literature and theatre through his profound plays and sonnets.

## Early Life and Career

Shakespeare’s early life was marked by modest beginnings. He was born to John Shakespeare, a glove-maker, and Mary Arden, the daughter of a wealthy farmer. Little is known about his education, but it is believed he attended King Edward VI School in Stratford-upon-Avon.

In 1582, at the age of 18, Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway, who was eight years his senior. They had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Around 1590, Shakespeare moved to London to pursue a career in theatre.

He soon joined the Lord Chamberlain's Men (later known as the King's Men), one of the leading acting companies in London. By the early 16th century, Shakespeare had become a successful playwright, actor, and part-owner of the Globe Theatre, which was central to the English Renaissance drama scene.

## Major Works

Shakespeare’s works are categorized into three main genres: comedies, tragedies, and histories. His plays explore a vast range of human emotions and experiences, from love and revenge to power and morality.

### Tragedies

- **Sonnet 18 ("Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer's Day?")**: A famous ode celebrating the eternal beauty of his beloved.
- **Sonnet 130 ("My Mistress' Eyes Are Nothing Like the Sun")**: A witty exploration of unidealized love and the imperfections of human beings.
